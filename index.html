            <p>I prefer cats to dogs, (even though I love them both). My first "pet" was actually a robotic cat. My parents gifted it to my sister and I as a tester pet. We passed their test, and one day was greeted by the most beautiful, little, black and white kitty-cat. From the age of eight, I've had cats ever since. I prefer tea to coffee, and have a slight mug obsession. I love mugs. And I love drinking hot beverages in them, which is a good thing, since that's literally the purpose of them. I also love a night in, just as much as I crave a night out. What led me to web-development? I've always considered myself as a creative person growing up. However, I never found the medium of creativity that was right for me. I tried drawing, and that didn't stick. I tried painting, and although I was the "Most Improved" in my class that semester, it still really wasn't for me. I love music, but don't expect me to play anything for you. It wasn't until I was exposed to coding via an internship, that I saw a creative outlet that could work for me. I mean, I'm literally creating and designing my own website, and that's pretty cool!      </p>
